# EpisodePicker
An app I created to randomly select an episode of star trek to watch

I used Jupyter Notebook for webscraping to collect the information about exisitng star trek episodes, i then stored these in a csv file. 
Using pandas i set up functions to select episodes at random or randomly within given parameters (Series of show in this case) 
Using tkinter i built a GUI which displays buttons for each series and has a sorted display window in which the episode information is shown.
